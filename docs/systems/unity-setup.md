# Usage
## Simulator
### Setup
1. Select the venue needed, download the correspoinding folder to local PC.
2. Go into the folder, you'll see a few executable files. The simulation requires you to run the **Server** file first, followed by the **Client** files sequentially.
3. Open the **Server** file, click **Play!**, select the map needed, click **LAUNCH**, you'll see the map loaded.
4. Go back to the folder, open the **Client01** file, click **Play!**, make sure the **Sim Mode** is at **DebugOnlyReference** (at the upper left corner). Change the **REMOTE DATA IP ADDRESS** to that of the drone you are gonna connect, if needed, then click **CONNECT**.
5. Redo step 4 for **Client02**, **Client03** etc., if there is more than one client needed until all client files are opened.
6. After each simulation, make sure all the .exe files are closed. Re-open them by following **step 1 to 5** for another round of simulation.

:::tip
### How to choose which client to connect which drone
1. Open a TX2 terminal and run $ `echo $simulator_id` which gives you a number that represents the first number of a client's UDP port.
2. `simulator_id` is one bigger than the number in client's name. 
3. So, for example, if `simulator_id` is 2, you should choose `client01`.
