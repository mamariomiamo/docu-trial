Four sets of camera has been calibration using the methods prescribed in the subfiles of this directories. Notably Cam1 to Cam 4. The calibration result and report are provided as per below.

Cam 2 and Cam 4 has been further verified using triangulation depth and its results has been mapped out. Note that this is meant to be used as a rough estimation of the accuracy of such model rather than used as an accurate method to gauge distance. A slight pixel sized deviation in the verification process will lead to huge discrepancies.
